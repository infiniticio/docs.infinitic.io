- messages that can not be handled by the engines are not put in dead letter queues

### ðŸª² Fixes

- refactor and simplify Pulsar implementations into a new infinitic-transport-pulsar module
- refactor and simplify in-memory implementations into a new infinitic-transport-inmemory module

---

## v0.8.0

10/24/2021

### ðŸš€ New features

- new dispatch syntax to start task and workflow. The need for a new syntax was induced by #130 (removing the async function)
- methods in the client have now an Async version, useful if we do not want to wait for message sending.
- workflows can now run multiple methods in parallel! A straightforward application is to easily retrieve the properties of a running workflow
- we now use String instead of UUID for ids. Using UUID was an implementation leak, that could prevent us in the future to let the user choose for an id

### ðŸª² Fixes

### ðŸª² Fixes

- fix bugs in workflow engines occurring in some edge cases

### ðŸš¨ Breaking changes

- in Infinitic configuration file:
  - serviceUrl renamed to brokerServiceUrl to be on par with Pulsar documentation
  - serviceHttpUrl renamed to webServiceurl to be on par with Pulsar documentation
removed setupPulsar from PulsarInfiniticAdmin (not needed anymore)
