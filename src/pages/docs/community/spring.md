title: Spring Integration

[TiarÃª Balbi](https://github.com/tiarebalbi) built an integration of Infinitic with Spring Boot, that you can see it [here](https://github.com/tiarebalbi/infinitic-spring-boot-integration).

It allows you to start Infinitic using the usual Spring Boot mechanisms, configuration files and dependency injection.

Thanks for your contribution.
