Infinitic is a framework that considerably eases building resilient and sophisticated business processes. It does this on top of [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) to benefit from its scalability and reliability.

Infinitic is very good at managing the execution of tasks on distributed servers according to any complex scenario. Moreover, Infinitic ensures that a failure somewhere will never break our workflows. 

At last, Infinitic lets us monitor everything through dashboards.

Possible use cases are:

- microservices orchestration
- distributed transactions
- data pipelines operations
- business processes implementation
- etc.

Infinitic brings a lot of benefits:

- **versatility**: you can use loops, conditions, data manipulations instructions provided by the programming language, without being limited by the capabilities of a DSL
- **maintainability**: your workflows are easy to understand, defined in one place, and versioned like any other piece of code
- **observability**: everything is closely monitored and exposed on dashboards
- **reliability**: workflows are immune to service/worker failures

To start, we can:

- learn the [terminology](/overview/terminology) at Infinitic,
- build our own [hello world app](/overview/hello-world).
- see [example apps](/overview/examples),
- ⭐️ us on [Github](https://github.com/infiniticio/infinitic)!
